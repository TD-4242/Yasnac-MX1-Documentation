Operators manual OCR for searchability.

A clean up of the OCR version of the Yasnac Operators manual for the MX1. Plus any additional notes while learning to use this antique hardware.

I purchased an Acroloc CNC machine from 1984 to play around with in my shop.  Locating documentation for it has been a challange so I wanted to create a repository that can be regularly updated.  This is the result.

If you have any updates please feel free to either open a PR or msg me directly.
