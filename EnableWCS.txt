Set Parameter 
  6046 D2 = 1 
  6038 D3 = 1

In order to set these "hidden" parameters you must dump
the current parameters and modify the decimal equivelent
to set these.  If you go to these under the PRM screen
they will be all blank.

1. Pres PRM, go to edit mode, set DNC to recieve file
2. Pres OUT, save file
3. Edit file and find #6038 and #6046
   In my case: (your numbers may be different)
     #6038 = 146
     #6046 = 0
4. Convert these decimal values to binary (google search for binary converter if you don't know how)
   In my case:
     Digit = 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
     #6038 = 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
     #6046 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
5. add 1 to digit 2 and 3 as instructed at top
     Digit = 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
     #6038 = 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
     #6046 = 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
6. Convert these new binary numbers back to decimal
     #6038 = 154
     #6046 = 4
7. Write these to the file generated in step 2 (make a backup before editing)
8. Set the parameter write dial to 1 (inside computer)
9. on PRM Mode Edit set DNC to send edited param file and hit In
10. Power off and on the Control head. (After the load head was unresponsive for me)
11. repeate steps 1&2 and verify that the parameters are as expected. 
12. Test setting WCS offset G54-G59, reset with G52
    you should no longer see alarm "020 - PROG ERROR (G)"
